The first step is go to master branch and check the files before to clone this repository. If you want to clone this project, I recommed you clone it outside of `~/.config` folder and after that, copy the `nvim` folder inside `~/.config`.
When you clone the project, I prefer start install all in this order:
 1. OhMyBash
 2. TMux
 3. XClip
 4. Ranger and VIfm
 5. Neovim
 6. Python3.10 and Pip3
 7. Neofetch
 8. Lazygit
 9. Htop
 10. Vtop
 11. Bashtop
 12. NCDU
 13. XAMPP
 14. MYCLI
 15. Beekeeper or Valentina Studio according your preference

> Note: I prefer Beekeeper than Valentina Studio
